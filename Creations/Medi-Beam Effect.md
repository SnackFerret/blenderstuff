# [Medi-Beam](https://github.com/hisprofile/blenderstuff/raw/main/Creations/blends/Medi-Beam%20Effect.blend)
[The Medigun beam effect (download)](https://github.com/hisprofile/blenderstuff/raw/main/Creations/blends/Medi-Beam%20Effect.blend), recreated in Blender using geometry nodes with all the parameters you would need. 

I recommend using empties as the start and end points. The beam will follow the Z axis of the points for a curve. You can scale an object to change the shape of the curve, so if you want it to be flat, scale the object to 0 on the Z axis. 

This is *partially* FPS locked, meaning everything will move at the same speed across different FPS values, but the bounciness will differ. You can compensate by lowering the bounciness value on lower FPS values. If you plan to copy and paste this object, make sure you enable `Cache` in the simulation tab of the beam.

Have fun!
