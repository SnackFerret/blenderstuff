# SFM vs. Blender - What's better for you?
This is mostly putting TF2 in either programs into perspective. There will be some bias purely because I have over 5,000 hours in Blender.

So, you've discovered the concept of creating TF2 content in Blender, and you'd like to try it for the first time! How different can it be from SFM? As it turns out, **very.**

From an animator's perspective, here's what you can expect out of
## Source Filmmaker
### Pros.
- Mass amounts of content available for users
  - With the workshop and included games, tons of assets such as characters, props and visual effects can be seamlessly loaded into SFM with little to no setting up required. And with how much is available on the workshop, thousands of SFM creators can feel catered to, as what they want is most likely there.
- Baked assets = Good performance
  - Maps, models and materials are all pre-compiled SIGNIFICANTLY reducing the amount of calculating for the final image. So for an animation program running on a game engine, it can actually run pretty well for how much detail is displayed on the screen.
- Particles galore
  - With the Source engine's incredibly versatile particle editor, visual effects is pretty much a drag-and-drop thing. The only drawback is that particles cannot be reused, so for effect like muzzle flashes, you'll have to add a new particle for every time you want to use it.
- Can be easy to learn
  - With so much cut out of the filmmaking process, it really narrows down how much the user needs to do. The UI is streamlined for animation, and you have the element tree viewer for any fine tuning you need.
### Cons.
- Outdated
  - The last update for SFM released on [12 Jan, 2015](https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/?appids=1840&appgroupname=Source+Filmmaker&feed=steam_updates#:~:text=Source%20Filmmaker%20%2D%20Valve-,Source%20Filmmaker%20version,8.14%20has%20been%20released.)
- Buggy
  - Being based off of the Source engine, it inherets all of the "Source Spaghetti." It can be unpredictable, crash often, and being a 32-bit program, once the memory limit has been it hit *will* crash. Not that Blender is any saint, but at least it isn't 32-bit.
- Restrictive
  - 

## From an animator's perspective, here's what you can expect out of SFM:
- Mass amounts of content can be seamlessy loaded, ready to animate.
